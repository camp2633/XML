    <description>The Chai Series was made possible in part with the support of Rimon: The Minnesota Jewish Arts Council, an initiative of the Minneapolis Jewish Federation. The Chai Series is an artistic collection of 18, 100-year old windows, restored and designed to highlight Jewish concepts of creation. It integrates historical religious art forms like Micrography, Calligraphy, and Illumination to highlight text, therefore becoming a form of visual midrash and the point of personal revelation by the viewer.</description>

    <description>I am an artist who finds value working with found objects and restoring beauty to these objects. Another creative outlet for me is home renovation and repairs. I enjoy restoring old wood in historic homes and creating beautiful spaces that invite reflection and spirituality.</description>
